<h1>Shikoku</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikoku">Shikoku</a> is the smallest and objectively coolest of the four main Japanese islands.</p>
<p>Shikoku is the best part of Japan because...</p>
<ul>
<li>It seems to have an huge influence relative to its small land area and population.<ul>
<li>It is the birthplace of <span>Shuji Nakamura</span>, Nobel Prize winner for the invention of the blue LED</li>
<li>Despite being a minor shrine, <span>Kotohira Jinja</span> is one of the few Shinto Shrines with a <em>bunsha</em> outside Japan (<a href="Hawaii%20Kotohira%20Jinsha.html">Hawaii Kotohira Jinsha</a>)</li>
<li><a href="Uwajimaya.html">Uwajimaya</a>, a Japanese supermarket chain in the PNW, was founded by a family from Shikoku and is named after a city on the island. But I'm not aware of businesses started by Japanese-Americans from other parts of Japan.</li>
<li>The orange ninja is ultimately named after the <a href="Naruto%20Whirlpools.html">Naruto Whirlpools</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Despite being separated from Honshu by only the Seto Sea, it feels strangely isolated from the mainland<ul>
<li>The Shinkansen serves the three other major Japanese islands, but there is no <span>Shikoku Shinkansen</span></li>
<li>The place in Japan that's farthest from Tokyo in terms of travel time is in <a href="Kochi.html">Kochi</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../P%20Language%20Literature/PL%20East%20Asian%20language%20and%20literature/Media%20set%20in%20Shikoku.html">Media set in Shikoku</a> seem to deal a lot with death and existentialism<ul>
<li>Why is that? Why is this a common theme? Is it because of the association with the <a href="GT%20Manners%20and%20customs/Shikoku%20Pilgrimage.html">Shikoku Pilgrimage</a>? Or is there a deeper reason?</li>
<li>And wanting to leave Shikoku is appears in a lot of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shikou is incredibly old<ul>
<li>It is the second island birthed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuniumi">Japanese creation myth</a> (as Iyonofutananoshima), and even then it was described as having <strong>four faces</strong><ul>
<li>The four modern prefectures' borders have been largely unchanged for over a thousand years</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is (claimed to be) the Onigashima from the Legend of Momotaro (<a href="Takamatsu.html">Takamatsu</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shikoku is one of Japan's poorer regions and has worse aging population problems, but it doesn't seem like it at all due to all the art and culture<ul>
<li><span>House of Toilet</span> looks like an architect got 10x the typical budget for a public bathroom<ul>
<li>Not having to worry about homeless people might help as Ibuki Island's population is rapidly shrinking</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <span>Yusuhara Library</span> wouldn't seem out of place in a major city, but it seems way too beautiful for a village of only a few thousand in the remote mountains</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Four Prefectures</h2>
<h3><a href="Tokushima.html">Tokushima</a></h3>
<p>Tokushima is located on the east of Shikoku.</p>
<h3><a href="Kagawa.html">Kagawa</a></h3>
<p>Kagawa is on the north east area of Shikoku and is Japan's smallest prefecture by area. Even though its capital, <a href="Takamatsu.html">Takamatsu</a>, is not the most populous city on the island, it serves as a political and cultural center due to its proximity to central Japan.</p>
<h3><a href="Ehime.html">Ehime</a></h3>
<p>Ehime is located in the north west area of Shikoku.</p>
<p>Ehime's capital, Matsuyama, is the largest city on the island.</p>
<h3><a href="Kochi.html">Kochi</a></h3>
<p>Kochi is located on the south side of Shikoku.</p>
<h2>Geology</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASP4W7GJYP4HPTLC02M.html">「おむすび山」なぜ多い？専門家に尋ねた</a><ul>
<li>Shikoku volcanoes formed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanukitoid">Sanukite</a>, named after Sanuki Province (<a href="Kagawa.html">Kagawa</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<ul>
<li>There's a campaign promoting <a href="https://cycling-island-shikoku.com/route.html">cycling the perimeter of the island</a><ul>
<li>Inspired by Taiwan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Cycling_Route_No.1">Cycling Route No. 1</a>. Both trips are about 10,000 km</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="GT%20Manners%20and%20customs/Hassaku.html">Hassaku</a> is an interesting regional holiday in <a href="Marugame.html">Marugame</a> in which horse shaped cakes are made for baby boys</li>
<li>The Shikoku Camera Club <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shikokucameraclub/">(Instagram)</a> runs contests for pictures taken in Shikoku</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pilgrimage</h3>
<p>The <a href="GT%20Manners%20and%20customs/Shikoku%20Pilgrimage.html">Shikoku Pilgrimage</a> visits 88 shrines across the island. It is one of the most famous aspects of Shikoku. Whenever I say, "I like Shikoku", people often go, "Oh, the place with the pilgrimage". But I don't think it's a particularly interesting piece of Shikoku culture because it isn't something people do every day. It helps sustain Shikoku tourism, but it's not a big part of the Shikoku identity.</p>
<p>More interesting are the "knock off" pilgrimages, like the one in Nagasaki. Or the <a href="https://www.skr.mlit.go.jp/kikaku/88-kei/">Shikoku 88 Views</a>, which is kind of stupid because it's obviously a tourism thing and one of the "views" is a train.</p>
