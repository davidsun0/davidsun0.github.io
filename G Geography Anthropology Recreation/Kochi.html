<h1>Kochi</h1>
<p>Kochi is the prefecture in Shikoku that I have the least to talk about. Kochi spans the southern side of Shikoku. The capital and most populous city is <span>Kochi City</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Gomen Station is a fun station to take a picture of yourself <em>dogeza</em>-ing at because the name is a homophone for "sorry".</li>
<li>Tosashimizu, Kochi is the place in Japan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YFwzkzZQQg">furthest from Tokyo by travel time</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Yusuhara</h2>
<p>Yusuhara, Kochi, is a small town of a few thousand located in the mountains and <a href="http://kumonoue-lib.jp/">has a library</a> designed by fucking Kengo Kuma. It's absolutely gorgeous and has no right being in such a remote location.</p>
