<h1>Okayama Castle</h1>
<p><a href="../img/Okayama%20Castle.jpg"><img src="../img/Okayama%20Castle.jpg" /></a></p>
<h2>Museum</h2>
<p>The original castle no longer exists, but a modern replica is built on the site. The inside of the castle is a museum about Okayama history.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the museum only if you are relatively fluent in Japanese and interested in Okayama history</p>
<ul>
<li>The artifacts while cool, are somewhat limited<ul>
<li>If any samurai armor / sword is good enough for you, you might as well just go to the Tokyo Museum instead of going all the way out to Okayama</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The museum is not very foreign language friendly</li>
<li>Much of the exhibit is focused on local history<ul>
<li>And how people from Okayama were involved in the Battle of Sekigahara</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
