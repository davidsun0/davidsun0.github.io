<p>The portmanteau of jean shorts is jorts; the portmanteau of jean kimono must therefore be jimono. This photo was taken in Tokyo in 2023; this kimono by Amanoya is 88,000 to 99,000 yen.</p>
<p>Americans on the internet often joke about the theoretical jean kimono without realizing that it actually exists. Maybe the idea of something that is both eastern and western, casual and formal is funny. Denim kimonos do exist, but they look nothing like blue jeans. Denim is a weaving style and has no influence on the final appearance.
