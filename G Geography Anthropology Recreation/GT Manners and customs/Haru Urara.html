<h1>Haru Urara</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haru_Urara">Haru Urara</a> (lit. beauty of spring) is a Japanese race horse based in <span>Kochi City</span>. She is notable for not winning a single race in a 113 race career.</p>
<p>Wikipedia lists other horses that never won, but it seems like only Urara became something of a cultural icon because of it. People still willingly bet on Urara and bought Urara merchandise.</p>
<p>So many people went to see Haru Urara that Kochi Racetrack saw its first profit in years and its demolition was canceled.</p>
<p>Haru Urara betting tickets were used as good luck charms for driving safety. The reason is a pun on 当たる (ataru), which can mean both to strike and to win a lottery / game of chance. By this logic, a losing horse bet conferred protection from having your car struck. Somewhat related is a fishing superstition explained in <span>Slow Loop</span> episode 3. In the anime, Hiyori explains that eating pickled plums is back luck for fishing. Since preserves don't spoil, they don't give food poisoning (shoku atari) which is once again the same verb for landing a fish.</p>
<p>The 2021 game <span>Uma Musume Pretty Derby</span> has Haru Urara as a playable character. Because of her poor stats, it is very challenging to win the important races with her.</p>
<p>As of 2023, Haru Urara is enjoying life in <span>Tochigi</span>. According to her caretaker, Urara only sleeps, plays, sleeps, eats, and sleeps. (Her stable stall is decorated with the Uma Musume character)</p>
