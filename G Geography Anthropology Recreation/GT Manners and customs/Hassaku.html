<h1>Hassaku</h1>
<p>Hassaku (eighth new moon) is a celebration hoping for the health of newborn sons. It is celebrated on the first day of the eighth month of the Japanese lunar calendar (late August to early September). It is specific to western <a href="../Kagawa.html">Kagawa</a>, in what was formerly <a href="../Marugame.html">Marugame</a> Domain.</p>
<h2>Dango Uma</h2>
<p><em>Dango uma</em> (horse cake) are decorated and eaten by families with young boys.</p>
<p>Dough made of rice and sugar is steamed and molded into a horse shape while still hot. A wood and metal frame is used to keep the rearing horse upright. The boys can sit on the <em>dango uma</em> because of the frame.</p>
<p>Next, the horse is painted with food coloring and decorated with fabric.</p>
<p>The <em>dango uma</em> also has a penis and scrotum because the horse itself is a symbol of health and virility. The boy eats the horse cake genitals.</p>
<p>After the Hassaku banquet, the leftover <em>dango uma</em> is shared with family, friends, and neighbors.</p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>There are records of Hassaku and its traditions in Seisanfushi (<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%A5%BF%E8%AE%83%E5%BA%9C%E5%8F%B2">西讃府史</a>) from the Edo Period.</p>
<p>One explanation of the origin of Hassaku is that the townspeople made a dango uma to celebrate the birth of a baby boy to the lord of <span>Marugame Castle</span>.</p>
<p>Another possible origin is from the legend of Magaki Heikuro (曲垣平九郎) skillfully climbing the stone stairs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atago_Shrine_(Tokyo)">Tokyo's Adago Shrine</a> on horseback, winning the favor of Tokugawa Iemitsu.</p>
