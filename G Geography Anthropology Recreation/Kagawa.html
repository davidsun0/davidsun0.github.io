<h1>Kagawa</h1>
<p>Kagawa Prefecture (formerly Sanuki Province) is Japan's smallest prefecture by land area and occupies the north eastern part of <a href="Shikoku.html">Shikoku</a>.</p>
<p>Kagawa's geography and climate is suited for growing wheat rather than rice. This wheat is used to make <a href="GT%20Manners%20and%20customs/Sanuki%20Udon.html">Sanuki Udon</a>, which is famous across Japan.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2020, Kagawa <a href="../K%20Law/Kagawaken%20Netto%20Geemu%20Isonshou%20Taisaku%20Jourei.html">passed a law</a> (the first of its kind in Japan) limiting the video game and internet use by minors.</li>
<li>The rock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanukitoid">Sanukite</a> is named after Sanuki Province</li>
<li>Buddhist monk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%ABkai">Kukai</a> was born in Kagawa and is (<a href="https://kotobaken.jp/qa/yokuaru/qa-72/">falsely</a>) believed to have invented Hiragana, one of the three major Japanese writing systems.<ul>
<li>(Hiragana evolved from kanji, so it is incorrect to say someone invented it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a Game Boy themed post office box somewhere in Kagawa. For the sake of the privacy of the residents, its exact location is kept secret. DO NOT RUIN THIS FOR THE REST OF US. Allegedly it is in the mountains of <span>Sanuki City</span>.</li>
