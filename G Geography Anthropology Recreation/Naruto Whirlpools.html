<h1>Naruto Whirlpools</h1>

<p>The Naruto whirpools are tidal whirlpools that occur in the Naruto Straights off <span>Naruto</span>, <a href="Tokushima.html">Tokushima</a>.</p>
<p>When the tide goes in and out, a large amount of water is forced through the rocky and narrow straight, forming whirlpools. <a href="https://www.uzunomichi.jp/attraction-of-naruto-whirlpools/">Map and explanation (Japanese)</a></p>
<p>The observatory deck of the Onaruto Bridge is open for viewing the whirlpools. The official website gives <a href="https://www.uzunomichi.jp/lang_en/#calender">dates and times</a> when the whirlpools are strongest, and there is a window of several dozen minutes around the peak when the whirlpools are located. The tides are strongest in late March / early April due to the snow melt.</p>

<p>The water at Naruto is blue. Like a bright blue. Unbelievably blue. I've seen a lot of water in my life and I have not seen anything like it. The color is extremely bright and saturated and it is absolutely beautiful. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to drink it.</p>
