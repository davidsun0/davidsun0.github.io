<h1>Jiamari and Jitarazu</h1>
<p><em>Jiamari</em> (字余り, extra syllables) and <em>jitarazu</em> (字足らず, missing syllables) occur in haiku, other 5-7-5 poems, and tanka. It's actually quite common for Japanese poems to not meet the syllable structure and the missing / extra syllables can be used to artistic effect.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>In the <span>Iroha Uta</span>, the second line <em>wakayo tareso tune naramu</em> (6 + 5 syllables) is missing a syllable (all others are lines of 7 + 5)<ul>
<li>The line is about searching for someone who does not have to experience death (they, like the 7th syllable, do not exist)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would argue that the third line of <span>Kimigayo</span> is NOT an example of <em>jiamari</em> even though it has 6 syllables where 5 are expected<ul>
<li>Likely, due to elision, the <em>re</em> and <em>i</em> in <em>sazare-ishi</em> are read as one syllable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the description of <a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm35406093">sm35406093</a>, this instance of the <span>Zen Whiskey</span> meme has a tanka (?) with double the amount of syllables: 膳膳膳膳膳 膳膳膳膳膳膳膳 膳膳膳膳膳 膳膳膳膳膳膳膳 膳膳膳膳膳膳膳<ul>
<li>It is a stupid tanka and I love it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><em>onaji desu anatato watashino daisetsusa</em></p>
<p>You and I are equally valuable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem by the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau has 5-8-5 syllable structure. It uses the most neutral pronouns for you (<em>anata</em>) and I (<em>watashi</em>), which uses up one too many syllables. If you really had to, you could use <em>kimi</em> for you and <em>boku</em> or even <em>ore</em> for I to get 5-7-5. However, all those options must be worse than the extra syllable. Since the sign is made with the poem as-is, this was decided on as the best option. <em>Kimi</em>, <em>boku</em>, and <em>ore</em> are non-neutral pronouns which express humility or lack thereof, undermining the poem's message of equality.</p>
