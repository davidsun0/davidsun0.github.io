<h1>Yuki Yuna is a Hero</h1>
<p>Yuki Yuna is a Hero is a multi-media franchise composed of novels and anime.</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yuna</em> is a series about teenage girls having teenager problems. While each story deals with issues like having difficulty making friends, finding your place in society, getting the recognition you deserve from parents and teachers, overcoming disasters, or forgiving bullies, the writing does so in a cute and lighthearted tone. Fans coined the term <a href="Neo%20Slice%20of%20Life.html">Neo Slice of Life</a> to describe how the anime weaves both the highs and the lows of normal life together into a cohesive, meaningful story.</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yuna</em> is a story about the fall of mankind; the establishment of ritual sacrifice to win protection and favor from the gods; the reincarnation of a god as a human; the plot of the religious elite to use her for their own nefarious purposes; and her voluntary sacrifice and resurrection which saves all of humanity from being forced to live in <a href="../../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Shikoku.html">Shikoku</a>. Amen.</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yuna</em> is a political commentary on the handling of the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and the 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic by the Japanese government. Through very heavy-handed apocalypse metaphors (the book published in 2015 talks of a disaster that happened "three years ago" and the book published in 2021 is about the early days of a global disaster), the books explore whose health and safety is prioritized during disasters. The fictional <em>Taisha</em> that governs Japan is willing to regularly kill its own citizens in order to maintain a (literal) veil of peace and security. <em>Yuki Yuna</em> also criticizes at how every level of society - student clubs; family structures; local, regional, and national governments - are complicit in hiding truth and manipulating members for "the benefit of society".</p>
<p><em>Yuki Yuna</em> is a <em>moe</em> anime about middle school girls just living out their lives. They spend their days volunteering at the park, learning to cook deserts for each other, and enjoying their hobbies. As Sonoko best put it, "Let's enjoy <a href="../../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Kagawa.html">Kagawa</a> life!"</p>
<h2>Watch / Read Order</h2>
<p>Like always, watch / read in release order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Yuki Yuna is a Hero Season 1</li>
<li>Washio Sumi is a Hero<ul>
<li>Optional, in my opinion. Honestly I'm not that big of a fan of <em>Washio Sumi</em>. It doesn't feel like its own self-contained story because it's made to feed into <em>Yuki Yuna</em> Season 1. It doesn't add that much to the overarching narrative as a result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nogi Wakaba is a Hero<ul>
<li><em>Nogi Wakaba</em> is the "other half" of the series. Although it takes place in a different time, it mirrors and greatly expands on the themes and ideas of <em>Yuki Yuna</em>.</li>
<li>The novels contain the short story Shiratori Utano is a Hero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kusunoki Mebuki is a Hero<ul>
<li>A side story, but powerful nonetheless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yuki Yuna is a Hero Season 2 <ul>
<li>Contains an anime adaptation of Washio Sumi is a hero (episodes 1-6). New stuff starts in episode 8.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yuki Yuna is a Hero Season 3<ul>
<li>Continuation of <em>Kusunoki Mebuki</em> which ties her story into Season 2</li>
<li>Heavily overlaps with Season 2</li>
<li>Epilogue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hero Apocrypha<ul>
<li>Short side stories about characters who are not heroes</li>
<li>Uesato Hinata is a Shrine Maiden</li>
<li><span>Fuyou Yuna is not a Hero</span></li>
<li>Karasuma Kumiko is not a Shrine Maiden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuyou Yuna becomes a Storyteller<ul>
<li>Sequel to Fuyou Yuna is not a Hero</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason the anime watch order is so messed up is because people can't be bothered to read. This watch order tries to match the book + anime order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Season 1</li>
<li>Season 2, Episodes 1-7 (Washio Sumi)</li>
<li>Fire Offering Arc<ul>
<li>Season 2, Episode 8 (Hero's Chapter)</li>
<li>Season 3, Episode 1-3 (Kusunoki Mebuki)</li>
<li>Season 2, Episode 9 (Hero's Chapter)</li>
<li>Season 3, Episode 4 (Kusunoki Mebuki)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Nogi Wakaba is a Hero<ul>
<li>Season 2, Episode 10-11 (Hero's Chapter)</li>
<li>Season 3, Episode 5-8 (Nogi Wakaba)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shinkon Arc<ul>
<li>Season 3, Episode 9 (Kusunoki Mebuki - This happens after the end of the novel)</li>
<li>Season 2, Episode 12 (Hero's Chapter)</li>
<li>Season 3, Episode 10 (Kusunoki Mebuki - This happens after the end of the novel)</li>
<li>Season 3, Episode 11 / Season 2, Episode 13 (The two episodes are pretty much identical)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
