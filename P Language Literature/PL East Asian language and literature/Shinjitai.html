<h1>Shinjitai</h1>
<p>After WWII, Japan simplified kanji as a part of language reform. Shinjitai (new characters) refers to the simplified kanji. Because the simplification process is analogous to <span>Simplified Chinese</span>, some patterns and characters are shared between the two scripts. Overall, I would say that Shinjitai tends to have fewer strokes than <span>Traditional Chinese</span> but more strokes than Simplified.</p>
<p>For Japanese spelling reform, see <span>Kanadzukai</span></p>
