</ul>
</li>
<li>食之无味，弃之可惜<ul>
<li>Tasteless to eat yet a shame to discard - Cao Cao</li>
<li>Cao Cao was eating a chicken when he decided the army's password to be "chicken rib". The phrase refers to how the rib isn't a good cut of meat but is also too substantial to be simply thrown away. Yang Xiu deduced that the phrase also referred to the upcoming battles in which case Cao Cao would likely withdraw the army soon. Yang told the soldiers and they began packing. Yang was executed for his disobedience.</li>
