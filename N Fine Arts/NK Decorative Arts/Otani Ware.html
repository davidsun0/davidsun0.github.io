<h1>Otani Ware</h1>
<p>Otani is a kiln site in <a href="../../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Tokushima.html">Tokushima</a>. Otani ware specializes in the large pots used for indigo dyeing. Otani ware is unique for its <em>nerokuro</em> technique (lit. sleeping potter's wheel): the potter's assistant lies on his / her side and pedals the wheel.</p>
<p>Why did Tokushima potters develop <em>nerokuro</em>? Korean potters making similarly large vessels (albeit for food, not dye) alone. Even if the size or weight necessitates multiple people to work on one vessel, why lie down sideways? Why not have the wheel operator standing upright? Or using a crank?</p>
<p>Nowadays, due to the decline of traditional indigo dyeing, Otani potters have started making functional tableware.</p>
