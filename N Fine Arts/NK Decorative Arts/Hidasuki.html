<h1>Hidasuki</h1>
<p>Hidasuki (緋襷, <em>fire chord</em>) is a type of <a href="Bizen%20Ware.html">Bizen Ware</a> decoration. Hidasuki are bright red lines made by wrapping clay in rice straw. During firing, the rice reacts with the clay and forms bright red streaks. For a detailed chemical explanation of the mechanism, see <a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Study%20of%20Hidasuki%20Pattern%20Kusano.html">Scientific Study of Hidasuki Pattern on Bizen Stoneware</a>.</p>
<p>Bizen is now part of modern day <a href="../../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Okayama.html">Okayama Prefecture</a>. Hidasuki has become a symbol of the area and is often part of the local art.</p>
