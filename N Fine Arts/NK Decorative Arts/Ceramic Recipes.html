<h1>Ceramic Recipes</h1>
<p>I've been a hobbyist potter since spring of 2022. I work out of a local community studio and have been experimenting with mixing glazes, underglazes, and clay bodies from raw materials since 2023. I only have access to kilns that fire to cone 5 / 6, so most of my recipes are also for midrange temperatures.</p>
<h2>Glaze Recipes</h2>
<p>These are glaze recipes I have created or modified. Please try them out!</p>
<p>The process of testing and refining a glaze is important. I encourage you to read about the process I used to develop these recipes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Clear%20Glaze%20Development.html">Clear Glaze Development</a><ul>
<li>Low thermal expansion to fit porcelain without crazing</li>
<li>Low movement to keep my <a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Cobalt%20Underglaze.html">Cobalt Underglaze</a> decorations crisp</li>
<li>This is what got me into making my own glazes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Tenmoku%20Development.html">Tenmoku Development</a><ul>
<li>I adapt my clear glaze into a Tenmoku</li>
<li>I adjust the chemistry to control the amount of crystallization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Oribe%20Development.html">Oribe Development</a><ul>
<li>A recreation of Japanese ash-based Oribe glazes</li>
<li>I use glaze chemistry to substitute Japanese materials with North American materials</li>
<li>I talk about how I adapt a cone 10 glaze to cone 6, lowering the firing temperature by 100 degrees centigrade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../Q%20Science/QD%20Chemistry/Cosmic%20Indifference.html">Cosmic Indifference</a><ul>
<li>A project to get a unique effect without high temperatures or specialized kilns</li>
<li>Based on the Galactic Indifference glaze</li>
<li>Lowers the firing temperature by 100C from cone 10 to cone 6</li>
<li>Removes the requirement for soda firing - can be used in electric kilns</li>
</ul>
