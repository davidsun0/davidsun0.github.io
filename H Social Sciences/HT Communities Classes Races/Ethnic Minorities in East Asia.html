<h1>Ethnic Minorities in East Asia</h1>
<p>This article is about people who immigrate from one East Asian country to another. Despite looking the same and having similar cultural values, they are still often marginalized in their host countries.</p>
<p>There are also groups of people who were colonized but not completely "integrated" into their colonizers' culture.</p>
