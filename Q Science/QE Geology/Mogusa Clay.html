<h1>Mogusa Clay</h1>
<p>Mogusa Clay is a clay from Mino (modern day <a href="../../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Gifu.html">Gifu</a>). Named after the loose fiber used for moxibustion, the clay is special for its coarse, sandy texture. When trimmed, it organically splits and tears.</p>

<h2>Clay Properties</h2>
<p>I have not worked with Japanese Mogusa clay, so these properties are deduced from pictures and videos.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short (not plastic)<ul>
<li>The surface is rough with voids when cut with a knife</li>
<li>The clay naturally splits and tears when worked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low iron content<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tougeishop.com/products/detail/2876/">Mogusa Clay sold on Tougei Shop</a> fires to the same off-white in both oxidation and reduction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>High in grog / silt<ul>
<li>Clay is still workable despite having very low plasticity, so its strength must come from grog</li>
<li>Grog size is fine, likely 40 mesh or finer<ul>
<li>Trimming tools do not leave gouges and pits like <a href="../QD%20Chemistry/Mulcoa%20Grog%2047-20x50.html">Mulcoa Grog 47-20x50</a> does</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the tearing properties of Mogusa are purely physical, it can be possible to alter the color and maturity at will by carefully selecting the clay and feldspar portion. Then the issue becomes the filler: how much of it and what kind?</p>
<p>Silt is non-plastic with particles finer than sand but coarser than clay. For reference, clay particles are 2 microns and finer. There are several definitions of silt particle size:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pavementinteractive.org/reference-desk/materials/aggregate/astm-aggregate-and-soil-terminology/">American Standard of Testing Materials</a>: 200 mesh or smaller (74 microns)</li>
<li>United States Department of Agriculture: 500 microns - 20 microns (35 - 635 mesh)</li>
<li>International Society of Soil Science: 200 microns - 20 microns (70 - 635 mesh)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Splitting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This test compares a typical white stoneware body and the same body with 10% added 50-80 mesh molochite grog. ... Notice another issue: The jagged edges of the disk, it is more difficult to cut a clean line in the plastic clay.</p>
<p>From Digital Fire: <a href="https://digitalfire.com/picture/rokgavadid">Do grog additions always produce better drying performance?</a></p>
<p>Notice the edges have peeled badly during cutting, this is characteristic of very low plasticity clays.</p>
<p>From Digital Fire: [Albany Slip DFAC dried disk](https://digitalfire.com/picture/jywpowetim</p>
<p>[Splitting] can happen during tooling. While the plasticity is sufficient for throwing, at lower water contents it drops off quickly. This is a mix of 5% bentonite, 10% ball clay and 85% calcined alumina. For better trimming some refractory capability needs to be sacrificed for more ball clay (perhaps 20%).</p>
<p>From Digital Fire: <a href="https://digitalfire.com/picture/gugfibuxet">A body containing excessive non-plastics having a high bentonite addition for plasticity</a></p>
<p>When formulating a porcelain that employs a white expensive plasticizer the optimal range of prcentages can be surprisingly narrow. The trimming behavior is one indicator. When there is insufficient plasticizer the tool will chatter (of course in extreme cases edges will tear). Smoothing the corners after trimming (using your finger) will aslo give you an indication. If there is too much plasticizer, the material will ball up under your finger, if there is insufficient it will not smooth out well.</p>

<p>From the above snippets, I would make a Mogusa clay by</p>

<li>Large grained kaolins should work well</li>
<li>Can be augmented with <a href="Bentonite.html">Bentonite</a> without losing the tearing effect when leather hard</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A large percentage of non-plastic material<ul>
<li>Silt is primarily quartz</li>
<li>30-40% can be <a href="Nepheline%20Syenite.html">Nepheline Syenite</a> for cone 6 or 20-30% <a href="Feldspar.html">Feldspar</a> at cone 10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grog, mostly 30 mesh and finer<ul>
<li>This augments the plasticity since the base clay is so short</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trimming</h2>
<p>The clay is trimmed while still relatively soft with a dull (wooden) knife.</p>
<p>If the clay is too dry, it won't tear and create texture.</p>

<p>This clay successfully tears but trimming it is difficult. The clay has a very narrow window between workable and too stiff. When too stiff, the clay comes off in large chunks and it's very easy to tear the foot ring completely off.</p>
<p>The clay needs to be more plastic.</p>

<p>I think the grog is unnecessary. It's possible to get the tearing texture just from the grainier ingredients in the clay. This is the silty content: silica and pyrophyllite grains facilitate the tearing.</p>
<p>Same tearing texture can be found in</p>
