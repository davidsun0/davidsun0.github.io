<h1>Tennessee #10 Ball Clay</h1>
<p>Tennessee #10 is a <span>Ball Clay</span>. Unlike other Kentucky and Tennessee ball clays, #10 has much lower silica content, yet still has high plasticity. Thus it is useful in making <span>High Alumina Clay</span>.</p>
<h2>Chemistry</h2>
<p>Tennessee #10 has significantly less silica content compared to other ball clays, yet it is still extremely plastic. I find Tennessee #10 extremely useful in making white stoneware bodies for soda firing. These clay bodies need plasticity but not silica; typically the more plastic a clay is the more silica content it has.</p>
<h2>Physical Properties</h2>
<p>Tennessee #10 is extremely plastic, like other ball clays.</p>
