<h1>Sand</h1>
<p>Sand is theoretically pure silica. Beach sand is contaminated by iron and other minerals, but often the sand at pottery supplies has been washed, sorted, and sieved to a standard size.</p>
<h2>As a grog</h2>
<p>Sand can be wedged into clay as <a href="../QD%20Chemistry/Grog.html">Grog</a>, but it won't improve throwing. Sand particles are round and won't interlock to increase clay strength.</p>
<p>However, sand does provide interesting texture during trimming and <span>Soda Firing</span> depending on the particle size.</p>
<h2>Preventing fusing</h2>
<p>Since silica is extremely refractory, it can be used to prevent pots from fusing to cookies and kiln furniture. This is useful for porcelain pots if the foot rings are fusing and plucking.</p>
<p>After glazing, I apply some craft glue (polyvinyl acetate - it burns off easily) on the foot ring. Less is more! This is especially true if you're using an electric kiln; the elements don't like the soot. While the glue is still wet, I set the pot on a pile of sand. The sand sticks to the fresh glue and dries in place. The pot can be packed into the kiln as usual.</p>
