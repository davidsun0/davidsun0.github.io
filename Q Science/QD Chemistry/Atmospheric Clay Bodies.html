<h1>Atmospheric Clay Bodies</h1>
<p>These are some clay bodies I mixed up and tested. They are designed to flash in soda and wood (atmospheric) firings.</p>
<h2>Atmospheric Body 1</h2>
<p>This is one of the first custom clay bodies I mixed from scratch. I didn't know what I was doing back then.</p>
<p>The body is supposed to be for <span>Soda Firing</span>. It has a <a href="Silica-Alumina%20Ratio.html">Silica-Alumina Ratio</a> of 2.77, designed for <a href="Alkali%20Flashing.html">Alkali Flashing</a> which may be a little low. However, I didn't choose the clays based on what color they might flash in soda firing. They were chosen just based on what I had lying around.</p>

<p>Low plasticity body. <a href="../QE%20Geology/Optikast%20Kaolin.html">Optikast Kaolin</a> provides no plasticity at all.</p>
<p>The <a href="../QE%20Geology/Nepheline%20Syenite.html">Neph Sye</a> content is probably higher than necessary. May do better at cone 6 than cone 10.</p>
<p>Sand is Ottawa Sand. I'm not sure what mesh it is exactly, but the particles feel uniform and around 40-50 mesh. It is undetectable when throwing and barely noticeable when trimming.</p>

<p>A high alumina clay body for soda firing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Extremely plastic due to the high ball clay content.</li>
<li>Throws and trims extremely smoothly.</li>
<li>Decently mature at cone 6, though I haven't done any measurements.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this is probably a decent clay body, it doesn't justify the high time and energy investment in mixing. There are commercial clays like Laguna's B-Mix Wood which feel similar - it would be equivalent apply this recipe as a slip on white stoneware.</p>

<p>I see the recipe as a combination of two clay bodies:
- A mix of Goldart and Hawthorne, both which naturally mature at cone 10
    - The specific proportion is up to personal preference - Hawthorne has a coarse grind and the iron speckles in the clays differ in size and quantity
- A porcelaneous stoneware
    - This half is made of kaolin, white ball clay, and 20% neph sye for maturity
    - The lack of silica and proportion of kaolin is used to keep the alumina:silica ratio at 3 for soda flashing</p>

<p>Clay body designed for large vases in soda firing. Exceptional throwing properties due to that 10% grog. The downside is that it is absolutely hell on trimming tools.</p>
<p>Bellying out without a hand or rib on the outside produces very intense cracking patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>2.99 SiO2:Al2O3 ratio without sand and grog for flashing in soda firing</li>
<li>Hawthorne Bond added for iron speckles and small quartz grains</li>
<li>Goldart for additional iron speckles without larger mesh grains</li>
<li>As much Tennessee #10 Ball Clay as possible to increase plasticity without increasing the silica ratio (highest alumina content ball clay available to me)</li>
<li>A small amount of kaolin to target 3.0 SiO2:Al2O3 ratio</li>
<li>Some Neph Sye for maturity (Goldart and Hawthorne Bond are already fairly vitreous at cone 10, so not much is needed)</li>
<li>10% grog to make it easier to throw large without feeling grainy</li>
</ul>
