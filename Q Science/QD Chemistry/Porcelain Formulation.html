<h1>Formulating Porcelain Bodies</h1>
<p>Formulating a porcelain body is straightforward, but does involve a lot of work and testing. Porcelains make a lot of hard tradeoffs (color, translucency, plasticity, glaze fit, cost) so if commercial porcelain bodies don't meet your needs it may be a good idea to mix your own.</p>
<p>The basic idea is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Kaolin</span> for whiteness and translucency<ul>
<li>Translucency requires very white kaolins</li>
<li>For off-white, opaque porcelains, <span>Ball Clay</span> is a cheap and very plastic substitute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feldspar for maturity<ul>
<li>A mix of feldspar and <a href="../QE%20Geology/Wollastonite.html">Wollastonite</a> can lower maturing temperature by several cones.</li>
<li>Frit (melted glass) can create soft-paste porcelains that <a href="https://digitalfire.com/glossary/zero4">mature as low as cone 04</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silica for glaze fit<ul>
<li>The more silica, the less glazes craze.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plasticizers<ul>
<li>Since kaolin is typically not very plastic, 1-3% bentonite can greatly improve throwing. However bentonite can decrease translucency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Porcelain Trilemma</h2>
<p>There are three attractive properties of porcelain and they are all in conflict with each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translucency / Whiteness</li>
<li>Workability</li>
<li>Cost</li>
</ul>
<p>The whitest materials are hard to mold and throw on the wheel and are expensive. The most <a href="Plasticity.html">plastic</a> clays are contaminated with iron, but cheap.</p>
<p>There is another axis, which is firing temperature. Firing hotter relaxes these constraints somewhat as feldspar can be replaced with kaolin, increasing workability.</p>

<h2>Cone 6 Porcelain</h2>
<p>Tony Hansen has done a lot of research in this area and used it to make Polar Ice at Plainsman Clay.</p>
<p>Here is his recipe for <a href="https://insight-live.com/insight/share.php?z=rEgF5sd2dk">L3778D</a>, a mid range translucent throwing porcelain.</p>

<h2>Cone 04 Porcelain</h2>
<p><a href="https://insight-live.com/insight/share.php?z=7LuGR4KXJn">Tony Hansen's soft paste (using frit, powdered glass) porcelain, named Zero4.</a> It is translucent at cone 04. With the use of glass, this recipe shows that translucent porcelains can be fired to very low temperatures. Honestly at this point it feels like you're just making glassware with kaolin dissolved in it.</p>
