<h1>Epsom Salts</h1>
<p>In ceramics, epsom salts (magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 7H<sub>2</sub>O) is used as a flocculant. It thickens glazes and engobes and it increases plasticity in clay bodies.</p>
<h2>Glazes and Engobes</h2>
<p>Epsom salts flocculates ceramic slurries - it thickens glazes and engobes without changing the water content. Glazes low in clay (or even with no clay!) will suspend better and can be applied in a thin even layer. Epsom salts are very powerful and should be added slowly while vigorously mixing. Less than 1% of the slurry should be epsom salts by weight, which means adding grams to liters of glaze. Dissolving epsom salts in water to make a concentrated solution is also an option - the liquid will disperse easier and quicker than crystals.</p>
<p>Due to the small amount used, epsom salts are not a meaningful source of magnesium. For the purpose of glaze chemistry, it can be ignored.</p>
<p>See <a href="Slurry%20Rheology.html">Slurry Rheology</a> for more detailed information on how to adjust glazes and engobes.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="Iron%20Sulfate.html">Iron Sulfate</a> has similar flocculation properties.</li>
<li><span>Soda Ash</span> and <span>Sodium Silicate</span> are the opposites of epsom salts; they deflocculate glazes.</li>
