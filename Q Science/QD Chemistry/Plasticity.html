<h1>Plasticity</h1>
<p>Plasticity is the measure of how a material (like clay) can be stretched and stay in its new shape. Compare this to elasticity, which describes how a material can return to its original form.</p>
<p>When potters talk about plasticity of a clay body, it is highly subjective. But the main property when working with wheel thrown pots is the ability to throw tall, thin, and even cylinders.</p>
<p>Tony Hansen has a <a href="https://digitalfire.com/glossary/plasticity">great primer on plasticity</a>, but because he talks about plasticity in relative terms, it can be hard to gauge what ingredients do in a glaze or clay body.</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>High plasticity clays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are stiffer on the wheel and in wedging and require more strength to move</li>
<li>Are easier to form into very round objects and have less of a tendency to wobble</li>
<li>Take longer to dry from a slip to usable clay</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relative plasticity</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="../QE%20Geology/Bentonite.html">Bentonite</a><ul>
<li>The most plastic clay. An addition of 3% or less can turn an otherwise difficult to use clay body into a highly plastic one.<ul>
<li><span>VeeGum T</span> can make <a href="https://digitalfire.com/picture/tapdukuwol">non-plastic materials throwable</a> with just 4%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1% or 2% can completely suspend and harden a glaze with no other plastic materials.</li>
<li>Clay bodies with bentonite absorb water very slowly and do not generate much slip when throwing. The clay can feel slimy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Ball Clay</span><ul>
<li>Very plastic clay body material. Typically 30%-50% American ball clay alone is enough to plasticize a clay body.</li>
<li>10-15% ball clay is enough to suspend and harden a glaze.</li>
<li>Most ball clays from the southern US (Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama) behave very similarly and only differ slightly in chemical composition and fired appearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stoneware Clay<ul>
<li>Clays like <a href="../QE%20Geology/Hawthorne%20Bond.html">Hawthorne Bond</a> and <a href="../QE%20Geology/Goldart.html">Goldart</a> have a plasticity between that of ball clay and kaolins. Stoneware clays are not a unified group and their plasticities cannot be generalized. Test your clay materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span>Kaolin</span><ul>
<li>Kaolins are the least plastic clay. When people talk about plastic kaolins, it is relative to other kaolins. Clay bodies that are &gt;50% kaolin can still be difficult to throw.</li>
<li>Typical glazes use 15-30% kaolin for glaze suspension.</li>
<li>Different brands have different degrees of plasticity.<ul>
<li>Casting slip kaolins like <a href="../QE%20Geology/Optikast%20Kaolin.html">Optikast Kaolin</a> border on zero plasticity</li>
<li><span>Tile 6 Kaolin</span> has <a href="https://digitalfire.com/picture/fucvuhixyx">bentonite added</a> in the manufacturing process and is substantially more plastic than other kaolins, but still much less than ball clay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grog</h2>
<p>Adding <a href="Grog.html">Grog</a> increases the working properties of the clay body. ~3% of grog can make a lower plasticity clay much more workable.</p>
