<h1>Argument for Empirical Glaze Testing</h1>
<ul>
<li>I think glazes should be tested empirically<ul>
<li>Rather than chemically (i.e. relying too much on a glaze calculator)<ul>
<li>Some beginner glaze mixers over rely on glaze calculator<ul>
<li>Use calculated thermal expansion as a crutch to fit glazes to clay bodies</li>
<li>Give up on the first try if an online glaze doesn't meet expectations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are things a calculator can't tell you<ul>
<li>Materials that deviate from ideal (whiting is typically "contaminated" with dolomite)</li>
<li>Poorly melting glazes are highly dependent on physical properties of glaze</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because hobbyist ceramics are highly variable and volatile<ul>
<li>Ingredients can get contaminated</li>
<li>Some people measure quite fast and loose</li>
<li>Kilns can fire unevenly - cold spots that are 1 cone colder are not uncommon, kilns may over fire, natural cooling is highly dependent on kiln packing, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Test empirically<ul>
<li>Can produce extremely simple glazes<ul>
<li>My oribe glaze is conceptually a blend of only 3 ingredients (feldspar, wood ash, silica) in simple ratios, fits a stoneware, and is pretty</li>
<li>Very useful if going for aesthetics and not functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limits and food safety need to be checked empirically anyways<ul>
<li>No guarantee of food safety unless you send a pot off for lab testing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knowing how to adjust a glaze is far more useful than just going blindly off of a printout<ul>
<li>Scientific method establishes a cause-effect between ingrendiets and glaze qualities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How<ul>
<li>Change the percentages of different ingredients</li>
<li>Perform line blends to see if an ingredient / ratio needs to go up or down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
