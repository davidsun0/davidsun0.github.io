<h1>Kiln Atmosphere</h1>
<p>Kiln atmosphere refers to the chemical contents of the air inside the kiln.</p>
<h2>Oxygen / Carbon Monoxide</h2>
<p>Aside from electric, kilns are heated by burning hydrocarbons.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the combustion is complete, the end products are carbon dioxide and water. This is called oxidation</li>
<li>If the combustion is incomplete, the firing produces carbon monoxide<ul>
<li>This is called reduction</li>
<li>The carbon monoxide reacts with metal oxides in the clay body and glaze<ul>
<li>The metal oxides are reduced</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The intensity of the reduction affects the appearance of glazes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heavy reduction can be "sooty", producing pure carbon</li>
</ul>
<h2>Soda firing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sodium carbonate is dumped / sprayed into the kiln<ul>
<li>The sodium carbonate vaporizes and sodium reacts with the clay and glaze</li>
<li><span>High Alumina Clay</span> will show <a href="Alkali%20Flashing.html">Alkali Flashing</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Salt firing is similar but uses rock salt (NaCl)</li>
<li>Some potters use a mix of sodium carbonate and sodium borate</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it should be possible to perform a controlled version of soda firing by dipping pots in a sodium carbonate solution</p>
<h2>Wood firing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wood is used as the fuel source, often pine because it can burn very hot and efficiently</li>
<li>Wood ash is often deposited on the surface of pots<ul>
<li>Ash can be eliminated by firing in saggars</li>
<li>Deposited ash can form a natural glaze - some potters leave pots unglazed, fully exposed to the effects of ash</li>
<li>Wood ash is primarily made of calcium and magnesium along with some iron</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
