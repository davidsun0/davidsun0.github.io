<h1>Wollastonite Porcelain</h1>
<p>This cone 6 porcelain uses a combination of <a href="../QE%20Geology/Wollastonite.html">Wollastonite</a> and <a href="../QE%20Geology/Feldspar.html">Feldspar</a> to mature at lower temperatures. This decreases the flux content needed, creating more room that can be given to silica (for better glaze fit) and kaolin (for better workability).</p>
<p>The idea came from research by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.126">Turkmen et al.</a> and was used to successfully mix a translucent cone 6 porcelain body.</p>
<h2>Version 1</h2>
<p>There is a well known hard paste porcelain formula for cone 10. It is 25% <a href="../QE%20Geology/Feldspar.html">Feldspar</a>, 25% <span>Silica</span>, and 50% <span>Kaolin</span>. I adapt this clay body by removing 5% feldspar and replacing it with 5% <a href="../QE%20Geology/Wollastonite.html">Wollastonite</a>. According to  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2014.12.126">Effect of wollastonite addition on sintering of hard porcelain</a> by Turkmen et al., this should theoretically decrease the maturation temperature by 125 degrees celsius. This should take the firing temperature down from cone 10 (1285C) to cone 4 (1162C).</p>

<p>A sample was mixed without any bentonite or other additives. The clay body was mixed from dry ingredients into a slurry, dewatered on a plaster slab, and then shaped into test tiles the same day. The clay was not aged. The clay samples were bisque fired to cone 05 and then fired to cone 6 in reduction.</p>
<p>The samples are an attractive cool white, typical of glassy porcelains. The sample was slightly translucent where thin (approximately 3mm).</p>
