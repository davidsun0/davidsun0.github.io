<h1>Wadding</h1>
<p>Wadding is pieces of refractory material used to keep pots from sticking to the kiln, kiln furniture, or other pots. After firing, it breaks off from bare clay easily.</p>
<h2>Classic Wadding</h2>
<p>This is a classic recipe that can be used in all environments, including <span>Soda Firing</span> and <span>Wood Firing</span>.</p>

<p>Calcine half of the kaolin by putting some powder in a bisque firing. Alternatively, I've used <a href="../QE%20Geology/Optikast%20Kaolin.html">Optikast Kaolin</a>, which has almost zero plasticity, to good success. Calcining removes the plasticity. The purpose of using non-plastic kaolin is to reduce the drying shrinkage.</p>
<p>The wadding needs a very specific amount of water to be shapeable, but too little water makes mixing difficult. I solve this problem by mixing the ingredients in a wet slurry and then dewatering it on a plaster slab, like I do when <a href="Slurry%20Mixing%20Clay%20Bodies.html">Slurry Mixing Clay Bodies</a>.</p>
