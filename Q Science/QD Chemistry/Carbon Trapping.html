<h1>Carbon Trapping</h1>
<p>Glazes with <span>Soda Ash</span> can melt aggressively enough to absorb carbon soot from the <a href="Kiln%20Atmosphere.html">Kiln Atmosphere</a>. The glaze will become gray to black depending on the amount of carbon absorbed. This phenomenon is known as carbon trapping.</p>
<p>Carbon trapping is most commonly associated with <a href="../../N%20Fine%20Arts/NK%20Decorative%20Arts/Shino%20Glazes.html">Shino Glazes</a>, but any glaze can carbon trap. Just add 10-20% soda ash.</p>
<p>Aside from soda ash, <a href="Borax.html">Borax</a> can also carbon trap. Both chemicals are very low melting fluxes. Additionally, both are soluble and will gather on the glaze surface when drying.</p>
<p>Heavy reduction is a requisite for carbon trapping. There must be enough soot in the kiln when the soda ash melts and reduction must be strong throughout the firing such that the trapped carbon does not burn off.</p>
