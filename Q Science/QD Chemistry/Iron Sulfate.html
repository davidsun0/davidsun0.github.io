<h1>Ferrous Sulfate Heptahydrate (FeSO4 7H2O)</h1>
<p>Iron sulfate is a water soluble iron compound. It comes in green crystals that are easily dissolved in water. When it is dissolved in glaze and then dried, it turns a light yellow. Ferrous sulfate heptahydrate is readily available at gardening or hardware stores as a soil pH modifier.</p>
<h2>Flocculant</h2>
<p>Iron sulfate is not an attractive soluble source of iron in glazes because of its flocculating properties. Gram for gram, it feels like it has similar strength to magnesium sulfate. 1% can greatly thicken a glaze. 4% turns an otherwise normal glaze into jelly.</p>

<p>Iron sulfate is highly soluble in water, but I still find it easier to dissolve it in water before adding insoluble glaze ingredients.</p>
<h2>Chemistry</h2>
<p>Iron sulfate is 30% Fe2O3, with the remainder being sulfur oxide and water, both of which will burn away during firing.</p>
