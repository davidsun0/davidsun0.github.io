<h1>enza</h1>
<p><a href="https://enza.fun">enza</a> is a web-based gaming platform launched in 2018, created by Bandai Namco Nexus (formerly BDX). Its selling point is that players don't need to download or install apps. Players could also easily switch between mobile and desktop. The platform is HTML5 based and I assume comes with developer kits which simplify the server and client code.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>Because it was launched in spring of 2018, enza likely didn't take advantage of <span>WebAssembly</span>, which was released in late 2017.</p>
<p>I tried playing Idolmaster Shiny Colors in 2018, but found the experience quite bad. Living in America probably didn't help as server round trip times would increase. The animation and UI were jittery and the assets weren't high quality. I think the tech just wasn't ready even for a 2D turn-based simulation game (highly doubt that enza is capable of handling action titles). Maybe it would work for strategy games which are less computationally expensive. But at that point it would probably make more sense to directly develop a browser game.</p>
<h2>Games (as of 2024)</h2>
<p>I can't be sure without looking at profit records, but based on the game lineup I don't think Enza can be called a success. It has had fewer than 10 titles released so far, with multiple games ending service in 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li>Idolmaster Shiny Colors (launch title, flagship product) 2018/04/24 - present</li>
<li>Dragonball Z Butchigiri Match 2018/05/16 - 2020/03/16</li>
<li>Pro Yakkyuu Famisuta Master Owners 2019/02/28 - 2020/08/31</li>
<li>Queen's Blade WHITE TRIANGLE 2019/03/14 - 2020/5/18</li>
<li>Konjiki no Gash!! Golden Memories 2019/03/27 - 2020/03/30</li>
<li>Neko to Dragon 2019/04/03 - present</li>
<li>NARUTO X BORUTO Ninja TRIBES 2020/03/05 - 2021/12/16</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic is probably what killed most of the projects.</p>
<p>Concerningly, Idolmaster Shiny Colors, the main launch title, also released a native app in 2019, defeating the purpose of enza.</p>
