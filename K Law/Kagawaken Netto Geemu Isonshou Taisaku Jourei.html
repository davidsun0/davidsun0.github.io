It limits the internet and video game usage of minors in <a href="../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/Kagawa.html">Kagawa</a>. The ordinance came into effect on April 1st, 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minors (children 18 and under) are limited to<ul>
<li>60 minutes of video games per day on weekdays<ul>
<li>90 minutes on weekends and holidays</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>smartphone use only before 10pm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no enforcement or punishment - parents and guardians are encouraged to follow these rules at home. This ordinance is the first of its kind in Japan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm36607906">Mitaka Sakumaru posted a video of "Gamer Udon"</a> the day the ordinance came into effect. By making an <a href="../G%20Geography%20Anthropology%20Recreation/GT%20Manners%20and%20customs/Sanuki%20Udon.html">Udon</a> bowl with RGB lighting, Sakumaru claims to have made a "gaming Kagawa that you can't eat in Udon Prefecture" (whatever that means).</p>
<p>Later that month, <a href="https://www.pokemon.jp/info/event/detail/20314.html">The Pokemon Company opened a Slowpoke-themed park</a> in <span>Ayakawa</span>. Internet comedians were quick to joke out that kids can only spend 60 minutes a day at the park.</p>
